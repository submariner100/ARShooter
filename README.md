# ARShooter
Application exploring ARKit - Collisions
first commit - This application is a shooter type game where the user can shoot down items in his own environment. For this game 
the targets are eggs floating around in the air, but the targets can be anything!!!! I will look into making a proper game out of this 
once I have finished this project.
Lessons learnt - Setting up the UI environment for ARKit on Xcode, using tapGesturesRecognizers, using SCNPhysicsBodys and shapes.
Applying forces on objects, setting up scenes and nodes, using the transform matrix for location, position and orientation for the 
Point of View, using materials and textures.
second commit - Collisions
